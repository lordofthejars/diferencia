= Run Diferencia
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Assumptions:

* [x] You've xref:installation.adoc[installed Diferencia] using any of the methods explained there.
* [x] Have `curl` installed.
* [x] You have checked that `curl 'http://rest.ensembl.org/info/ping' -H 'Content-type:application/json'` returns a JSON document.
* [x] You have checked that `curl http://now.httpbin.org/` returns a JSON document.

== Starting Diferencia

To start diferencia you only need to run next command from your terminal:

`diferencia start -c http://rest.ensembl.org -p http://rest.ensembl.org`

This command just starts Diferencia proxy, configuring it to use http://rest.ensembl.org (`-p`) as the primary (_old version_) and http://rest.ensembl.org (`-c`) as the candidate (_new version_).

NOTE: For sake of simplicity now both versions point to te same host, but in a real use case, hosts would be different.

Then run next `curl` command:

`curl 'http://localhost:8080/info/ping' -H 'Content-type:application/json' -i`

And the response is `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` because obviously, both are the same version so they are producing the same output.

What is happening under the cover when you do that `curl` operation is that Diferencia proxy replaces the host with _primary_ host and sends the request to it (_http://rest.ensembl.org/info/ping_) and then do the same with the _candidate_ host, sending the request to it (_http://rest.ensembl.org/info/ping_).

After that, both responses are compared and if they are *strictly* equal then an HTTP 200 OK method is returned from the proxy.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default Diferencia just skip any unsafe operation like `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE` and `PATCH`, because they are not safe to run them blindly without taking into consideration their side effects.

You can remove this restriction by starting Diferencia with `--unsafe` flag.

[TIP]
====
Diferencia has an endpoint at `/healthdif` that can be used to check when diferencia is ready to receive requests.

[#modes]
== Running Modes

In the previous example, both responses must be *strictly* equal (this means that JSON schema and each key/value must be equal).

.About Headers
****
By default Diferencia only takes into consideration status code and body content and headers, for example, are ignored.

You can enable header verification by setting `--headers` flag.

You can also set which header values should be ignored by using `--ignoreHeadersValues Accept, Accept-Charset`

Notice that this only apply to header value, not the key.
So for the previous example, it is checked that both primary and candidate contains the same headers (pair key/value) but in case of `Accept` and `Accept-Charset` only it is checked that there are the keys present, but they don't need to have the same value.
****

But there are other modes that we are going to describe in next sections:

[#strict]
=== Strict

`Strict` mode checks that every key/value is strictly equal.

[#subset]
=== Subset

`Subset` mode checks if candidate response is a subset of primary response.
For example:

.V1
[source, yaml]
----
{
    "name": "Alex",
    "surname": "Soto"
}
----

and

.V2
[source, yaml]
----
{
    "name": "Alex",
    "surname": "Soto",
    "fullname": "Alex Soto"
}
----

`V2` document is a subset of `V1`, so in this case, Diferencia will say that both documents are equal.

[#noise]
== Noise Detection

If you have Diferencia started from <<Starting Diferencia>> section, stop it and start it again with next command:

`diferencia start -c http://now.httpbin.org/ -p http://now.httpbin.org/`

Now we are configuring Diferencia proxy to redirect requests to _http://now.httpbin.org/_ which basically returns the current time.

So you can run next `curl` operation:

`curl 'http://localhost:8080/' -i`

And the response is `HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed`. 
This is happening because although you are sending the request to the same service, it is returning the current time which of course it is not the same in both calls.
This thing that it is pretty obvious makes that Diferencia result is a failure, saying that both services are not compatible (so there is a regression), when the truth is that they are equally valid, but having a *value* different.

To fix this there is a noise cancellation algorithm that detects these dynamic values and suppress them from JSON document.
This algorithm sends the request to not two instances but three.
Two are the old instances (_primary_ and _secondary_) and one to the new instance (_candidate_).

The request to _primary_ and _seconday_ returns a valid request (since old instances are the correct ones), then from their responses, Diferencia checks for the differences between both responses. 

Since both responses are valid (because the source is the same but different instances), the differences that are between them are just noise that should not take into consideration for response validation.

Then detected noise is removed from _primary_ and _candidate_ response, and they are compared, if they are equal, then you know that everything is fine.

This can be summarized in next schema:

.Noise Cancellation
image::noise.png[]

Now stop Diferencia and start it again with next command:

`diferencia start -c http://now.httpbin.org/ -p http://now.httpbin.org/ -s http://now.httpbin.org/ -n`

You are setting URLs for _primary_ (`-c`), _secondary_ (`-s`), _candidate_ (`-c`) and finally that you want to enable noise reduction (`-n`).

Now just execute the same `curl` command as before.

`curl 'http://localhost:8080/' -i`

And now the response is totally different returning a `200 OK`.

=== Manual Noise Cancellation

Sometimes autoamtic noise cancellation is not enough.
Usually this might happen when you have random values or when you know beforehand the fields that produces noise and you don't want any automatic detection to save some execution time (1 extra call).

.About Random Values
****
Suppose that you have a service where one field is a random value from 0 to 9.
It could happen that _primary_ and _secondary_ field contains the same value.
In this case this would not be considered as noise.

But then _candidate_ field could be a different number of the one calculated in _primary_ and _secondary_.
In this case the request would be considered failed, since there were no noise detection algorithm applied, but you as a API designer knows that this field should be considered noise.
****

To avoid this problem, to flags are provided and they are enabled when `noisedetection (-n)` flag is enabled.
These flags are `ignoreValues` and `ignoreValuesFile`.

`ignoreValues`:: list (in CSV) of _JSON_ pointers of elements where their values should be ignored in comparision.

`ignoreValuesFile`:: path of a file where each line is a _JSON_ pointer of element where their values should be ignored in comparision.

IMPORTANT: You need to have noise detection enabled to be able to specify manual noise cancellation.

[#mirroring]
== Mirroring

Diferencia can be started as a mirrored proxy.
In this mode Diferencia, the output of primary call is redirected to the caller. 

The error is notified not as response but stored internally to be consumed by Prometheus or Rest call or UI.

In this way you can use Diferencia for mirroring public traffic and checking for any regression.

To enable it, you need to use `--mirroring` or `-m` as parameter.
