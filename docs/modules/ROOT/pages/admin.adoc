[#admin-api]
== Rest API

Diferencia has an administration console that can be accessed as a Rest API to configure some of the Diferencia parameters without having to restart it.
At this time these parameters are:

* serviceName
* primary
* candidate
* secondary
* noise detection
* mode

By default the admin console is listening port `8082` but it can be configured by using `--adminPort` argument.

To update any of the parameters you only need to send a JSON document using `PUT` http method to `/configuration` endpoint to given host and configured port.

The JSON document must follow next schema:

[source, json]
----
{
  "serviceName" : "",
  "primary" : "",
  "secondary" : "",
  "candidate" : "",
  "secondary" : "",
  "noiseDetection" : "", // <1>
  "mode" : "" // <2>
}
----
<1> Noise Detection valid values is: `Strict`, `Subset` and `Schema`
<2> Boolean as string `true` or `false`

TIP: You can set all parameters to be updated in the document, and all of them will be updated at once. It is not necessary to send N requests one for each change.
